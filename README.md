# NHS Review

- This Repository is aimed at critically studying and reviewing for the [National Health Stack (NHS)](https://abdm.gov.in:8081/uploads/NHS_Strategy_and_Approach_1_89e2dd8f87.pdf), it's drawbacks and the negative forth-comings.
- This Project will be reviewing the NHS in the following aspects:
  - *Framework Design Perspective:*  Review of the design and the shortcomings there as well as the potential cracks in the design which might lead to compromise in users' data privacy and it's consequent security thereof.
  - *Social Perspective:* Review of how the proposed software architecture and it's design will affect the users' human rights and their rights to privacy as well as  a critical address of how-if the software is used to portray any kind of social bias towards a certain class of people in the country.  - *Scale and Structure Perspective:* Review of how should the proposed architecture scale in a humongous population of 1.4 billion v/s How it has actually scaled in real scenarios with some of the  products and services launched by the government.



## Resources for Study

- Taking [The sinister undercurrents of the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission](
https://www.academia.edu/57235772/The_sinister_undercurrents_of_the_Ayushman_Bharat_Digital_Mission?source=swp_share) as the base article of this research, related articles mentioned throughout this paper as well some of the more jargonous terms that I am not aware will serve as the starting points to this study
- I will also study all the internal and announced schemes related to **Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission** to understand a full picture of the entie system, helping to review the thus called "backbone of digital health infrastructure" the **National Health Stack**

## How will I do it?

- I am mentioning all the resources [here](resources_table.md) in a list fashion.
- Each of this article or topic(s) of study will have a Card on the related Project Kanban.
- Each of the Articles will have a seperate branch and a seperate PR, so that it is easier for me to review and go back to certain aeticles and even track progress
- Each Card will of course have an PR and I will keep pushing files to the branch as and when I keep making notes about them.
- As and when I am done with any article, the PR will be merged and I shall update the link to the file in the table below (original as well as my understandings' document link).
